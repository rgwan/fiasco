Welcome to Fiasco.OC!
----------------------

Fiasco is a microkernel and can be used to construct flexible systems. We at
TU Dresden use it as a base for our TUD:OS system which supports running
real-time and time-sharing applications as well as virtualization
concurrently on one system. However, Fiasco is not only suitable for big and
complex systems, but also for small, embedded applications.

This distribution contains the Fiasco.OC microkernel and tools to build
it. User level applications are not included in this package.

Building the Fiasco kernel
--------------------------

To compile Fiasco you need a recent version of gcc and a recent version of
GNU binutils, GNU make and Perl version 5.6 or later.

Change to the directory where this README is located and
create a build directory with "make BUILDDIR=build" and change to the
'build' directory. Optionally modify the default configuration using
"make menuconfig". Then compile the kernel by typing "make".

The kernel binary can then be found as 'fiasco' in the build directory.

For further information refer to: https://l4re.org/fiasco/build.html
